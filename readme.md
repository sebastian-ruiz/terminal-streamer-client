# Terminal Streamer Client

The client is written in python. It requires the (Meteor Terminal Streamer)[https://github.com/vephinx/terminal-streamer].

### What is it?

This allows you to pipe anything from your terminal to a web page.

### Getting Started

1. Install the (Terminal Streamer)[https://github.com/vephinx/terminal-streamer] web application written in Meteor.
2. Set the admin password in `main.py`
3. (Optional) move `main.py` to your path, make it executable and rename it. I named it `tstream` and it lives at `/usr/local/bin`.
4. Done!

Now try `ls | tstream`.

### Arguments

- Run `tstream clear` to clear the terminal stream.
